# Mission-to-Mars
Web scraping using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, MongoDB and Flask.

## Project Overview
In this project, we were tasked with gathering data on the upcoming mission to Mars from various sites on the World Wide Web for displaying on a dedicated web application. To avoid searching for this data manually, we created the web application to scrape the websites on demand with a click of a button, and store the data in a noSQL database. We were able to complete the web scraping by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter integrated with our Python code. Once all of the data was scraped from the websites, we used a MongoDB database to store it for rendering in our web application. Finally, we used Flask to configure our web application for veiwing in our internet browser.

Here is the webpage that was generated for our completed web application:

Clicking the "Scrape New Data" button allowed up to update the Latest Mars News and Featured Mars Image sections of the webpage.
